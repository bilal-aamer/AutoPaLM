-> SystemMemory: Manages the memory of the system, including loading or creating memories, appending information to the memory, marking tasks as completed, and summarizing conversations.
-> TaskGenerator: Generates tasks and subtasks using the palm generative AI model.
-> CodeExecution: Tests and processes code snippets, including extracting code snippets from generated content.
  
4.Main Function:
-> Initializes an initial prompt for the conversation.
-> Creates instances of TaskGenerator and SystemMemory.
-> Selects a memory or creates a new one.
-> Loads or creates the selected memory and updates it with the initial prompt.
-> Generates a list of tasks using the TaskGenerator and appends them to the memory.
-> Generates subtasks for each task, appends them to the memory, and processes them using the CodeExecution class.
-> Updates the memory with the task summary and generates a next step based on the progress.
-> Prints the next step, summary of completed tasks and subtasks, and the summary of the entire conversation.
