# AutoPaLM

AutoPaLM is a Python-based AI program created with the help of PaLM and other LLMs. This was started from scratch. The program stores and manages the generated content in a memory system, allowing for context-aware responses and the ability to filter, archive, and retrieve information based on user input.


## Features

- Generate questions and answers based on user-defined prompts
- Store and manage generated content in a memory system
- Filter and archive memory based on user-defined thresholds
- Save and load memory settings for easy retrieval and customization
- Detect and save code snippets from generated content

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the `main.py` script to start the Auto-PaLM program:
```
python main.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to set goals, enter prompts, and generate questions and answers.

## Functions

- `set_clear_goals()`: Allows users to define goals for the AI system.
- `generate_text(prompt)`: Generates text based on the given prompt.
- `process_answer(question, answer, memory)`: Processes the answer, detects code snippets and updates the memory.
- `filter_memory(memory, prompt_embedding, threshold)`: Filters the memory based on the relevancy of the given prompt.

## User Input

Users can interact with the program by entering the following commands:

- Enter a prompt: Users can input a prompt for the AI to generate questions and answers based on the prompt.
- `exit`: Exits the program.
- `Clear memory`: Clears the memory of the program.
- Enter the number of iterations: Users can input the number of iterations for generating questions and answers. The default is 1.

## Memory Settings

- `num_prompts`: The number of prompts to remember.
- `filter_context_threshold`: The threshold for filtering context based on relevancy (between 0 and 1).
- `archive_memory_threshold`: The threshold for archiving memory (between 0 and 1).
- `filter_memory_threshold`: The threshold for filtering memory based on relevancy (between 0 and 1).

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to improve the Auto-PaLM program. Please feel free to submit suggestions and issues to discuss potential improvements or report bugs, and even help me understand terms and the correct process of open-source projects.

I'm so excited to see how both AutoPaLM will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI in the future!
